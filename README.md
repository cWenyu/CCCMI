# Aquality 2.0

Aquality 2.0 is a **Mobile Application** , it helps Citizen Scientists to get more accurate water quality via **AI model** to analysis insects and uses **IOT** technology to talk with 2 sensors (**PH, Temperature**) to get accurate extra information of water body.

Technologies: 

- **Hardware:** Arduino

- **App:** React Native

- **Cloud:** AWS, PubNub 

- **AI:** Yolov3+LabelImg

- **Backend**: Django + PostgreSQL

- **UI Testing**: Appium + WendriveIO

- **API Testing**: Postman + newman + Github Actions

  

## Folder Description

**.github/workflows**: GitHub action workflows used in CI pipeline
